Hello.

My name is Kemisha Bailey. For as long as I can remember, I've always had an innate passion in caring for those around me, and when my grandmother needed attention, I was there. Over the years, that instinct has carried into my current profession. I've been a CNA for a total of 4 years now, and I do my job very well.

One day, there was an Alzheimers' patient who started throwing books at me. Instead of yelling at her, I called her name and attempted to calm her down, but since that wasn't working, I called the nurse for assistance. We ended up calming her down and everything was resolved.
